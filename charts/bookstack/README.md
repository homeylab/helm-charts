This chart deploys [bookstack](https://github.com/BookStackApp/BookStack), an app for self and/or collaborated documentation similar to confluence. This chart includes an option to install mariadb alongside it, enabled by default.

*Note: You should set some chart values by creating your own values.yaml and save that locally*

## Add Chart Repo
```bash
helm repo add homeylab https://homeylab.github.io/helm-charts/
# update the chart, this can also be run to pull new versions of the chart for upgrades
helm repo update homeylab
```

## Prerequisites
Ensure you either enable mariadb dependency, `mariadb.enabled`, or have an existing compatible DB server ready for bookstack. 

This chart provides the option to install mariadb by default from [bitnami](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/mariadb).

## Install
```bash
helm install bookstack homeylab/bookstack -n bookstack --create-namespace

# with own values file - recommended
helm install -f my-values.yaml bookstack homeylab/bookstack -n bookstack --create-namespace
```

#### OCI Registry Support
```bash
helm install bookstack -n bookstack oci://registry-1.docker.io/homeylab/bookstack --version X.Y.Z --create-namespace

# with own values file - recommended
helm install -f my-values.yaml bookstack -n bookstack oci://registry-1.docker.io/homeylab/bookstack --version X.Y.Z --create-namespace
```

## Upgrades
It is recommended to make a backup of mariadb database and also configuration files used by bookstack on it's pvc. See _Backup and Restore_ section for more details.

For additional steps that need to be done for upgrade, check upstream dependencies:
1. For Bookstack upgrade steps, check the [documentation](https://www.bookstackapp.com/docs/admin/updates/).
2. If using the Mariadb instance provided in this chart, follow Mariadb chart [upgrade](https://github.com/bitnami/charts/tree/main/bitnami/mariadb#upgrading) steps for DB upgrades and follow official Mariadb [guides](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/upgrading/).

```bash
helm upgrade bookstack homeylab/bookstack -n bookstack

# with own values file - recommended
helm upgrade -f my-values.yaml bookstack homeylab/bookstack -n bookstack
```

#### OCI Registry Support
```bash
helm upgrade bookstack -n bookstack oci://registry-1.docker.io/homeylab/bookstack --version X.Y.Z

# with own values file - recommended
helm upgrade -f my-values.yaml bookstack -n bookstack oci://registry-1.docker.io/homeylab/bookstack --version X.Y.Z
```

## File Exporter (Backup Your Pages)
This chart includes an optional [exporter](https://github.com/homeylab/bookstack-file-exporter) that will archive all your pages and their contents to a supported object storage provider(s) like minio, s3, etc.

This exporter creates a `.tgz` archive in a folder-tree layout to maintain the hierarchy of shelves, books, and pages.

Supported backup formats are shown [here](https://demo.bookstackapp.com/api/docs#pages-exportHtml) and below:

1. html
2. pdf
3. markdown
4. plaintext

A valid configuration should be provided and a valid object storage provider configuration(s) for remote archiving. Credentials can be specified directly in the config section or via `fileBackups.existingSecret`, see [here](https://github.com/homeylab/bookstack-file-exporter#authentication) for more information on getting/setting credentials for exporting. 

Example configuration below using minio, place inside `fileBackups.config` string block.
```yaml
# The target bookstack instance
# example value shown below
# if http/https not specified, defaults to https
# if you put http here, it will try verify=false, not to check certs
host: "https://bookstack.example.com"
# You could optionally set the bookstack token_id and token_secret here instead of env
# if existingSecret is supplied, can omit/comment out the `credentials` section below
credentials:
    # set here or as env variable, BOOKSTACK_TOKEN_ID
    # env var takes precedence over below
    token_id: ""
    # set here or as env variable, BOOKSTACK_TOKEN_SECRET
    # env var takes precedence over below
    token_secret: ""
# additional headers to add, examples below
# if not required, you can omit/comment out section
additional_headers:
  User-Agent: "helm-bookstack-exporter"
# supported formats from bookstack below
# specify one or more
# comment/remove the ones you do not need
formats:
  - markdown
  - html
  - pdf
  - plaintext
# if existingSecret is supplied, can omit/comment out the `minio_config._key` sections below
minio_config:
  # a host/ip + port combination is also allowed
  # example: "minio.yourdomain.com:8443"
  host: "minio.yourdomain.com"
  # set here or as env variable, MINIO_ACCESS_KEY
  # env var takes precedence over below
  access_key: ""
  # set here or as env variable, MINIO_SECRET_KEY
  # env var takes precedence over below
  secret_key: ""
  # required by minio
  # if unsure, try "us-east-1"
  region: "us-east-1"
  # bucket to use
  bucket: "bookstack-bkps"
  # path to upload to
  # optional, will use root bucket path if not set
  # the exported archive will appear in: `<bucket_name>:<path>/bookstack_export_<timestamp>.tgz`
  path: "bookstack/file_backups/"
  # optional if specified exporter can delete older archives
  # valid values are:
  # set to 1+ if you want to retain a certain number of archives
  # set to 0 or comment out section if you want no action done
  keep_last: 5
# optional how to handle additional content for pages
assets:
  # optional export of all the images used in a page(s).
  # omit this or set to false if not needed
  export_images: false
  # optional modify markdown files to replace image url links
  # with local exported image paths
  modify_markdown: false
  ## optional export of metadata about the page in a json file
  # this metadata contains general information about the page
  # like: last update, owner, revision count, etc.
  # omit this or set to false if not needed
  export_meta: false
  # optional whether or not to check ssl certificates when requesting content from Bookstack host
  verify_ssl: true
# optional if specified exporter can delete older archives
# valid values are:
# set to -1 if you want to delete all archives after each run
# - this is useful if you only want to upload to object storage
# set to 1+ if you want to retain a certain number of archives
# set to 0 or comment out section if you want no action done
keep_last: -1
```

To use this feature, set `fileBackups.enabled` to `true`. For more information on how to set configuration options, see exporter [docs](https://github.com/homeylab/bookstack-file-exporter#configuration).

## Backup And Restore Of MariaDB
When upgrading to different versions, you can do a back up of your mariadb data and bookstack files to have available just in case. This can be used for other situations like PVC resizing as well. Below is just an example but there any other ways to do this as well like PV backups via [Longhorn](https://longhorn.io/docs/latest/) as an example.

For more information on backup/restore steps, you should follow the documentation for upstream providers: 

1. [bookstack](https://www.bookstackapp.com/docs/admin/backup-restore/)
2. [mariadb](https://mariadb.com/kb/en/full-backup-and-restore-with-mariabackup/)

Example for mariadb:
- Stop bookstack pod
```
kubectl scale deploy -n bookstack bookstack --replicas=0
```
- Do a backup of mariadb bookstack db
```
# get into container
$ k exec -it -n bookstack bookstack-mariadb-0 bash

# dump
# root password is generated during install as a secret or user defined in the included mariadb instance
$ mariadb-dump -A -u root -p bookstack > backup.sql

# check dump
$ md5sum backup.sql

# copy dump to local and do a md5sum check
# or export to object storage/other if too large can try mounting PV with a utility pod after scaling mariadb down
$ kubectl cp bookstack/bookstack-mariadb-0:/tmp/backup.sql app_db_backup.sql
$ md5sum app_db_backup.sql
```
- Upgrade mariadb and/or bookstack version. Or doing another operation like PVC resizing, changing `storageClass`, etc.
    - You may have to scale down bookstack pod again if it is restarted during the upgrade.

- Then do a restore while bookstack pod is still down
```
# copy file to mariadb
$ kubectl cp app_db_backup.sql bookstack/bookstack-mariadb-0:/tmp/backup.sql
$ md5sum app_db_backup.sql

# restore
$ mysql -u root -p -D bookstack < backup.sql
```
- Scale back up bookstack and it should be reading from your initial database dataset
